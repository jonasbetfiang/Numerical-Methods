Consider a planet in an elliptical  orbit about the sun.  Assume the sun is fixed in space and at the origin of the coordinate system, and the planet is located at position .   Let  be the period of the planet's orbit, let  and  be one-half the major and minor axes of the ellipse,  and let  be the eccentricity of the ellipse, with   Then the coordinates of the planet at time  are given by
.
The eccentric anomaly, , is a solution of  Kepler's equation, a transcendental equation given by

By solving Kepler's equation (using fzero.m), you will compute and plot several different elliptical orbits of a planet.  
The closest approach to the sun occurs when  and .  To construct your plots, choose units so that the distance of closest approach is one.    At the closest approach,  and ,  so choose the unit of length  such that .  Solving for  and then  in terms of , we find 

If we also choose units such that the period of an orbit is one, then .  On a single plot, show the four orbits corresponding to , ,  and .
